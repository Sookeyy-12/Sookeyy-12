📄 Vault Processing Workflow (ICSDs)

🔹 Start

Start when Maturity Process is complete
→ PDM/DSC-48756



---

🔹 Step 1: Maturity Verification

Maturity date = Today, nominal TS + status = "Matured" and ISINs are in BNY Vault

Send MT599 to Concern Depository on Maturity
→ PDM/DSC-48530
→ PDM/DSC-48532



---

🔹 Step 2: Await MT599 from ICSDs

Received the MT599 from both ICSDs for Maturity
→ PDM/DSC-48897
→ PDM/DSC-48875



---

🔹 Step 3: Handle Missing MT599

Create a view for Missing MT599

Chase emails for missing MT599s to ICSDs/ISAs after delay of 3 weeks of Maturity



---

🔹 Step 4: No Global Notes Found

Note if there are no Global Notes in Vault

GDI automatically sets status to Pending Physical Confirmation



---

→ (Decision point)


✅ Yes:

Destruction confirmation provided for international or standalone Programs
→ GDI automatically sets status to Task Completion

Send a task to manually dispose notes.

PDM/DSC-48592

PDM/DSC-48593
